# GT RoboJackets RoboCup SSL - Off-Robot Firmware
The Georgia Tech RoboJackets team competes in the annual RoboCup Small Size League (SSL) competition.  This repository contains all of the firmware that we run on projects not part of our robots. More information on how our software works can be found on our [wiki](http://wiki.robojackets.org/w/RoboCup_Software) or on our [website](http://www.robojackets.org/). Also, check out our [2020 qualification video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MZREc9aj8k) to see our robots in action!

## The Competition

The soccer game is played between two teams of six robots each on a field with overhead cameras.  The field vision computer processes images from the cameras and sends out (x,y) coordinates of the ball and the robots.  Each team has a laptop that accepts the data from the vision computer and uses it to strategize, then send commands to robots on the field.

The official [RoboCup site](https://ssl.robocup.org/) has more information on the competition.
